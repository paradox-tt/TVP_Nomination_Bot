# 1KV Nomination Tool
<p>
This repository is dedicated to the development of a tool to nominate validators from the Thousand Validator Programme as well as specified lists of Validators.  The validator selection criteria and frequency can be specified and tweaked via a settings file.  Should this tool be used by a Parachain, it is envisaged that the parameters can be integrated into it's chain_state and loaded (into this application) upon startup.
